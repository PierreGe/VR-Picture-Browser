\section{Introduction}

\section{Problem to be solved}

The aim of this project will be to solve a real life problem that we all experienced. Since the numeric revolution, humans tend to take a ton of pictures. It is especially the case during their holidays, usually coming back with thousands of pictures. The problem that arise then is that human don't have a mean to explore them all other than browsing through them one by one. So, the idea for the project is to create a \textit{Intelligent Picture Browser (IPB).}
