\section{Introduction}
New generation user interfaces are developing day by day, with new tools, devices and different use cases showing up as the common users start using those devices everyday.
Of those devices, Virtual Reality is expanding as devices get more affordable and many research team started working on it. 

Imagining a future where we would use Virtual Reality on common basis, we thought about what an user could need that doesn't exist right now, and how to implement it to make the user feel comfortable in this totally new environment.

Imagine to have a collection of pictures you took on a trip, or on many trips. Imagine it now in a Virtual Reality environment, with pictures all over the place, like a 3D desk full of pictures not organized in album.

How can we use the Virtual Reality Environment and its computational power to make this collection of pictures organize and easily navigable?
The more user-friendly way is to have a system that recognizes your pictures, tagging them according to what is in the picture (e.g. a Dog, a sunset, ...), and allows you to query them via speech recognition.

\section{Problem to be solved}

The aim of this project will be to solve a real life problem that we all experienced. Since the numeric revolution, humans tend to take a ton of pictures. It is especially the case during their holidays, usually coming back with thousands of pictures. The problem that arise then is that human don't have a mean to explore them all other than browsing through them one by one. So, the idea for the project is to create a \textit{Intelligent Picture Browser (IPB).}
 
\section{Resolution requirements}

The resolution of the problem will take advantage of new opportunities in human-computer interaction such as Virtual Reality and voice recognition. It will also take advantage of advance in the state of the art of image recognition using a neural network.
